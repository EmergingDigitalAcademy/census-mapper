Civic Hackathon Weekend 2015 project: Still a work in progress, needs cleaned up and refactored

Running this is pretty easy. Clone the project, then make sure python is installed. Then
just use the built in HTTP server:

``` bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and then visit http://localhost:8000
