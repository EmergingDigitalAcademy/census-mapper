Civic Hackathon Weekend 2015 project: Still a work in progress, needs cleaned up and refactored

Running this is pretty easy. Clone the project, then make sure python is installed. Then
just use the built in HTTP server:

``` bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

You can change which datafile is loaded, and the color scheme by adjusting the two
variables around line 100 (`data_to_use` and `colors`)

and then visit http://localhost:8000
